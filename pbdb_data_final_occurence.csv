(2010) found Nummulites atacicus (SBZ8) and Assilina placentula (SBZ10).

The nannoplankton age, although not precise, is used here because dinoflagellates and nannoplankton from the Nammal Formation (beneath the Sakesar) indicate an NP11-NP13 age (Köthe (1988), Bybell & Self-Trail (2007)) that overlaps SBZ8-10.","Two calcareous nodular bands, interbedded with fine greenish and buff shales.","marl","lithified","","","","","lagoonal/restricted shallow subtidal","W.

AGE: Early-Middle Miocene in text based on macrofossil biostratigraphy. The age of the Navidad Formation and equivalent units has been a matter of debate for decades (see Gutiérrez et al. 2013; Finger et al. 2013, and Le Roux et al. 2013; references therein). An early Miocene age for the Navidad Formation was derived from studies on mollusks, shark teeth, Sr isotopes, and radiometric (Ar/Ar and K/Ar) dating of volcanic clasts in this unit (Gutiérrez et al. 2013; Finger et al. 2013; references therein). A middle to late Miocene or early Pliocene age for this unit had been interpreted from the study of foraminifers, ostracodes, pollen, Sr isotopes, and Ar/Ar dating of volcanic clasts (Finger et al. 2013 and references therein). Finger (2013) reexamined planktic foraminifers ascribed to the late Miocene and early Pliocene (in Finger et al. 2007), whereupon they recognized that they were misidentified and reassigned the assemblages to the early Miocene (Burdigalian Stage, ~21–16 Ma). Fossils in the Navidad Formation and correlative units yielded 87Sr/86Sr ages of 24–16 Ma (Nielsen and Glodny 2009).

Both the Jan Juc and overlying Puebla Formations are exposed at Bird Rock, but the Jan Juc Formation is coarser-grained. The associated fauna is also more characteristic of the Jan Juc Formation. AGE: Late Oligocene according to molluscan biostratigraphy of Darragh and Kendrick (2000) and Beu and Darragh (2001). Kelly et al. (2001) reported an age of 23.9 Ma for the basal Puebla Clay from Bird Rock, based on measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios from planktonic foraminifera, recalculated to 23.89-21.39 Ma by McLaren et al., 2009. McLaren calculated an age of 27.2-24.8 Ma for brachiopod shells (87Sr/86Sr) located about 7.5 m below the top of the Jan Juc Formation. Siesser (1979) found a possibly mid-Rupelian to earliest Aquitanian range for the Jan Juc Formation (NP24-NN1) and an early Miocene (NN2-NN4) age for the overlying Puebla Formation. Planktonic foraminifera in Li et al. (1999), including Globoquadrina dehiscens, suggest an early Aquitanian (M1b or mid N4) age for the basal Puebla Formation. Together, these lines of evidence support a latest Chattian age for the collection, although it could be basal Aquitanian. STRATIGRAPHIC POSITION: The description as ""junction beds"" or ""passage beds"" suggests that the collection is from the upper part of the formation, close to the distinct lithological contact with the Puebla Formation.","LITHOLOGY: Uppermost 3 m of the Jan Juc succession at Bird Rock is composed of skeletal packstones, locally glauconitic and bioturbated (Kelly & Webb, 1999). Li et al. (1999) describe a core at Bird Rock as containing interbedded glauconitic marls and clayey glauconitic wackestones, interbedded with thin (bryozoan) skeletal grainstone and mollusc packstone layers. LITHIFICATION: Some units are described as lithified grainstone but the skeletal packstone is ""very poorly indurated"" (Kelly & Webb, 1999).","wackestone","poorly lithified","argillaceous","","","","deep subtidal shelf","T.

Both the Jan Juc and overlying Puebla Formations are exposed at Bird Rock, but the Jan Juc Formation is coarser-grained. The associated fauna is also more characteristic of the Jan Juc Formation. AGE: Late Oligocene according to molluscan biostratigraphy of Darragh and Kendrick (2000) and Beu and Darragh (2001). Kelly et al. (2001) reported an age of 23.9 Ma for the basal Puebla Clay from Bird Rock, based on measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios from planktonic foraminifera, recalculated to 23.89-21.39 Ma by McLaren et al., 2009. McLaren calculated an age of 27.2-24.8 Ma for brachiopod shells (87Sr/86Sr) located about 7.5 m below the top of the Jan Juc Formation. Siesser (1979) found a possibly mid-Rupelian to earliest Aquitanian range for the Jan Juc Formation (NP24-NN1) and an early Miocene (NN2-NN4) age for the overlying Puebla Formation. Planktonic foraminifera in Li et al. (1999), including Globoquadrina dehiscens, suggest an early Aquitanian (M1b or mid N4) age for the basal Puebla Formation. Together, these lines of evidence support a latest Chattian age for the collection, although it could be basal Aquitanian. STRATIGRAPHIC POSITION: The description as ""junction beds"" or ""passage beds"" suggests that the collection is from the upper part of the formation, close to the distinct lithological contact with the Puebla Formation.","LITHOLOGY: Uppermost 3 m of the Jan Juc succession at Bird Rock is composed of skeletal packstones, locally glauconitic and bioturbated (Kelly & Webb, 1999). Li et al. (1999) describe a core at Bird Rock as containing interbedded glauconitic marls and clayey glauconitic wackestones, interbedded with thin (bryozoan) skeletal grainstone and mollusc packstone layers.
